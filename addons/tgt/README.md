# tgt
Shows helpful information about your target.

# installation
The easiest way is to just copy the entire `xitools/addons/` folder to your
Ashita installation directory (to be merged with the existing `Ashita/addons`
directory). However, all that is needed for this particular addon is:
  - `xitools/addons/tgt/`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/lin/text.lua`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/lin/packets.lua`

It plays quite nicely with `me` however, so consider installing that as well.

# usage
`/addon load tgt`

# known issues
- debuff tracking doesn't really work when too far from the target

# potential issues
- no unknown issues on the horizon
