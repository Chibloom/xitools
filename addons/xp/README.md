# xp
an experience tracker (like WatchEXP) but really bad. it collects all instances
of XP gain while it runs and can spit out xp/hr stats on command.

## usage
`/xp` will display an XP summary that spans back to the first instance of XP
you gained.

`/xp N` will display an XP summary for the past N minutes.

`/xp reset` will drop all collected data.
