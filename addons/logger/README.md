# logger
Pretty-logs packet data. No, you probably don't need this (it's just for ease of
development).

# installation
The easiest way is to just copy the entire `xitools/addons/` folder to your
Ashita installation directory (to be merged with the existing `Ashita/addons`
directory). However, all that is needed for this particular addon is:
  - `xitools/addons/logger/`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/core/set.lua`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/lin/packets.lua`

# usage
`/addon load logger`
