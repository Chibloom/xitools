# rcheck
Automates alliance readiness routines.

# installation
The easiest way is to just copy the entire `xitools/addons/` folder to your
Ashita installation directory (to be merged with the existing `Ashita/addons`
directory). However, all that is needed for this particular addon is:
  - `xitools/addons/rcheck/`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/core/set.lua`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/lin/packets.lua`

# usage
`/addon load rcheck` and run `/rcheck` when the time comes

# known issues
- not easily configurable

# potential issues
- no unknown issues on the horizon
