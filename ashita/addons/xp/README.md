# xp
It's kinda like `WatchExp`, but sucks a bit more. There's no on-screen display
but you can specify time ranges yourself.

# installation
The easiest way is to just copy the entire `xitools/addons/` folder to your
Ashita installation directory (to be merged with the existing `Ashita/addons`
directory). However, all that is needed for this particular addon is:
  - `xitools/addons/xp/`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/lin/packets.lua`

# usage
`/addon load xp`

# known issues
- it doesn't automatically break up "sessions"

# potential issues
- no unknown issues on the horizon
