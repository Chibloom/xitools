# me
Shows helpful information about... you!

# installation
The easiest way is to just copy the entire `xitools/addons/` folder to your
Ashita installation directory (to be merged with the existing `Ashita/addons`
directory). However, all that is needed for this particular addon is:
  - `xitools/addons/me/`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/lin/ffxi.lua`
  - `xitools/addons/libs/lin/packets.lua`

# usage
`/addon load me`

# known issues
- it won't automatically update your stats in certain circumstances (like
  recovering from weakness). a simple workaround is to open your equipment or
  status panes

# potential issues
- no unknown issues on the horizon
